## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# To create empty variables
filename= NULL
mean = NULL
SD = NULL
range = NULL
median = NULL
IQR = NULL
MAD = NULL
COV = NULL
DET = NULL
maxL = NULL
RR = NULL
L = NULL
ENTR = NULL
rENTR = NULL

n = 1

# To create a filelist
files=list.files(path = "test", pattern = ".txt")

# To set working directory to file location
setwd("~/OneDrive - Aarhus universitet/AU-Cognitive Science/3rd Semester/Experimental Methods 3/Exercise/Assignments/Assignment_2/test")

# To loop through each file and compute descriptors
for (file in files){
  d=read.delim(file)
  filename[n] = files[n]
  mean[n]=mean(d$f0)
  SD[n]=sd(d$f0)
  range[n]=range(d$f0)
  median[n] = median(d$f0)
  IQR[n] = IQR(d$f0)
  MAD[n] = aad(d$f0)
  COV[n] = sd(d$f0)/mean(d$f0)*100
  
  par = list(lgM =  50, steps = seq(1, 6, 1),  radiusspan = 100,
  radiussample = 40, normalize = 0,  rescale = 0,  mindiagline = 2,
  minvertline = 2,  tw = 0,  whiteline = FALSE,  recpt = FALSE,
  fnnpercent = 10,  typeami = "mindip") 

  ans= try(optimizeParam(d$f0, d$f0, par, min.rec= 3.5,
                     max.rec=4.5))
  if (length(ans) > 1) {
  
  results=crqa(d$f0, d$f0, delay=ans$delay, embed=ans$emddim,
               radius=ans$radius,normalize=0,rescale=0,mindiagline = 2,minvertline = 2)
  maxL[n] = results$maxL
  DET[n] = results$DET
  RR[n] = results$RR
  L[n] = results$L
  ENTR[n] = results$ENTR
  rENTR[n] = results$rENTR
  } 
  
  else {
    DET[n] = NA
    maxL[n] = NA
    RR[n] = NA
    L[n] = NA
    ENTR[n] = NA
    rENTR[n] = NA
  }
  
  n=n+1
}


# To create dataframe with pitch descriptors
Pitch_data=data.frame(filename, mean, SD, range, median, IQR, MAD, COV, DET, maxL, RR, L, ENTR, rENTR)


Pitch_data = read.csv("Pitch_data.csv")

# To create a variable according to the study
for (file in 1:nrow(Pitch_data)){
  if (grepl("Study1", Pitch_data$filename[file])){
    Pitch_data$Study[file] = 1}
  if (grepl("Study2", Pitch_data$filename[file])){
    Pitch_data$Study[file] = 2}
  if (grepl("Study4", Pitch_data$filename[file])){
    Pitch_data$Study[file] = 4}
}

# To create a variable according to diagnosis
for (file in 1:nrow(Pitch_data)){
  if (grepl("D0", Pitch_data$filename[file])){
    Pitch_data$Diagnosis[file] = "Control"}
  if (grepl("D1", Pitch_data$filename[file])){
    Pitch_data$Diagnosis[file] = "Schizophrenia"}
}

# To create a variable according to trial
Pitch_data$Trial=regmatches(Pitch_data$filename, regexpr("[T].*[0-9]", Pitch_data$filename))

Pitch_data$Trial = gsub("[T, _, f]", "", Pitch_data$Trial)

Pitch_data$Trial=substr(Pitch_data$Trial, 1, nchar(Pitch_data$Trial)-1)

# To create a variable according to ID
Pitch_data$Subject = substring(Pitch_data$filename, 2)

Pitch_data$Subject=regmatches(Pitch_data$Subject, regexpr("[S].*[0-9].[T]", Pitch_data$Subject))

Pitch_data$Subject = gsub("[A-Z]", "", Pitch_data$Subject)

# To merge the pitch data together with the demo data
Pitch_data$Diagnosis=as.factor(Pitch_data$Diagnosis)
Pitch_data$Subject=as.integer(Pitch_data$Subject)

new_data = base::merge(Pitch_data, demo_data, by = c("Subject", "Diagnosis"))

# To write to a csv file
write.csv(Pitch_data, "Pitch_data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
